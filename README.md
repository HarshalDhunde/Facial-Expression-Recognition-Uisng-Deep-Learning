# Facial Expression Recognition Using Deep Learning
<ul>
  <li>The project uses machine learning and a custom-built CNN architecture to predict facial expressions.</li>
  <li>The team experimented with different datasets, epochs, batch sizes, and CNN layers to optimize model accuracy.</li>
  <li>The user interface is simple and user-friendly, allowing users to upload images of faces for prediction.</li>
  <li>FastAPI handles the backend processing of the image, and the predicted expression is displayed on the frontend using React and Material UI.</li>
</ul>
