# Facial Expression Recognition Using Deep Learning
<ul>
  <li>The project is based on machine learning techniques and utilizes a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to predict facial expressions in images.    </li>
  <li>To optimize the accuracy of the model, the team experimented with various parameters such as the dataset used for training, the number of epochs, the batch size, and the   number of CNN layers.</li>
  <li>The user interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly, allowing users to easily upload images of faces for expression prediction. This can be done by either         dragging and dropping an image or using the “Upload Image” button.</li>
  <li>Once an image is uploaded, it is sent to the backend where it is processed by FastAPI. The image is then fed into the model, which predicts the expression present in the    image. This predicted expression is then sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user using React and Material UI.</li>
